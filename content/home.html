        <p class="text">The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow in value over a given period of time. For example, money deposited into a savings account earns a certain interest rate and is therefore said to be compounding in value. </p>
        <p class="text">Further illustrating the rational investor's preference, assume you have the option to choose between receiving $10,000 now versus $10,000 in two years. It's reasonable to assume most people would choose the first option. Despite the equal value at time of disbursement, receiving the $10,000 today has more value and utility to the beneficiary than receiving it in the future due to the opportunity costs associated with the wait. Such opportunity costs could include the potential gain on interest were that money received today and held in a savings account for two years.</p>
        <p class="text">The time value of money is the greater benefit of receiving money now rather than an identical sum later. It is founded on time preference. The time value of money explains why interest is paid or earned: Interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the time value of money. It also underlies investment. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset the preference to have money now.</p>

        <p class="text">‘GMO’ refers to any living thing that’s had its DNA altered using genetic engineering. This could be a plant, animal (including humans) or bacterium and it’s usually done to introduce a desirable trait into the organism, such as larger fruit or drought resistance. </p>
        <p class="text">You'll often see discussion of GM foods accompanied by images of fruit and veg with scary-looking syringes stuck in them (presumably by evil scientists), but these bear little resemblance to reality.</p>
        <p class="text">Humans have actually been performing a low-tech version of the GM process for thousands of years through selective breeding. Ancient farmers did it with maize (that’s sweetcorn to us), and transformed a tough, indigestible grain into the juicy yellow kernels we know today.</p>
        <p class="text">Genetic engineering allows us to directly alter the DNA of organisms without having to go through the process of breeding them over many generations. The gene for a desirable trait is isolated from a separate organism and inserted into the target, either manually or by attaching it to a (harmless) virus. GMOs can be used to treat disease, protect the environment and, of course, produce food.

        <p class="text">The robots are coming.</p>
        <p class="text">Not the killer models a frenetic Will Smith and friends saw filling public service positions in cinematic 2035, but robots nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p class="text">According to new research, almost two thirds (60%) of British people believe there will be a robot in every home within the next 50 years and only a quarter of them can't imagine a life where a robot wouldn't be part of their family.</p>
        <p class="text">It's a far cry from the culture of precarious terminators, paranoid androids and sex robots Hollywood might have us expect.</p>
        <p class="text">The Good Robot report, commissioned by consumer robotics and AI company Anki, utilised the all-encompassing genius of Envisioners CEO and futurist Dave Coplin to not only identify the current relationship between humans and robots, but how people expect to benefit from a life in tandem.</p>
        <p class="text">As you might expect, support with housework and chores topped the perceived benefits of robots in the home, with 27% of people thinking a home robot could save them two hours each day, but companionship followed closely behind. Almost a fifth of people said they wanted a home robot simply to keep them company.</p>
